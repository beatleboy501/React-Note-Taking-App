  NOTE TAKING APP
</div>

Using React.js and Meteor, I was able to create a new Note Taking app for practice. <br/>
The end goal is to integrate it with Evernote and OneNote. <br/>
Stretch goal would be to integrate it with the Concerts in town app here: https://github.com/beatleboy501/concert-app-es6 <br/>
